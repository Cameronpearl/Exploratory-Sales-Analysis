# Exploratory-Sales-Analysis-
Using SQL to extract insights into sales data

## overview

This project was created to practice my SQL skills. I downloaded a public dataset with sales data and uploaded it to my database in MySQL Workbench. I then used SQL to answer of the sales questions I think a company would be interested in asking. 
After making sure the data was clean in excel and using SQL scripts to find answers about the data, I created a dashboard using Tableau to vizualize and explain the insights taken from my analysis.

## Questions to explore

firstly, I wasnted to find out which product was the most profitable amd how many of each product were ordered.
Then I wanted to know the total sales in each city to see which cities were our most/least popular
Afterwards, I wrote a script to show the number of units sold for each product by city
Finally I was currious how much total sales vary by month.

## Answers

The most ordered item was the 4-pack of AAA batteries while the most profitable item was the Macbook Pro Laptop. The Macbook was by far the most profitable, generating almost double the sales of the next most profitable item.

San Francisco generated the most total sales with over 8 Million in total sales. Austin generated the least sales with just over 1 Million in sales.

The table created by the number of products sold by city script shows how popular each product is by city. While there are lots of insights that can be pulled from this table, the one that stood out to me was the fact that San Francisco was typically ordering the most amount of any given product. This showcases why that city was by far the most profitable. further data ana analysis would be needed to determine causation. 

Lastly and unsurprisingly, the month with the highest amount of sales is December. Most likey because of gift giving holidays such as Christmas. This is followed by the least profitable month January directly afterwards.
