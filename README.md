# Exploratory-Sales-Analysis-
Using SQL to extract insights into sales data

##overview

This project was created to practice my SQL skills. I downloaded a public dataset with sales data and uploaded it to my database in MySQL Workbench. I then used SQL to answer of the sales questions I think a company would be interested in asking. 
After making sure the data was clean in excel and using SQL scripts to find answers about the data, I created a dashboard using Tableau to vizualize and explain the insights taken from my analysis.
